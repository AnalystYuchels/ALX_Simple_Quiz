## 📁 Project Structure

```

.
├── index.html         # Main HTML file with the quiz layout
├── style.css          # Styles for quiz layout and interactivity
└── quiz.js            # JavaScript logic to validate the selected answer

```

## ✅ How It Works

1. The user is presented with a simple question: **"What is 2 + 2?"**
2. The user selects one of the multiple-choice answers using radio buttons.
3. When the **Submit Answer** button is clicked:
   - JavaScript checks the selected answer.
   - If correct (`4`), the app displays “Correct! Well done.”
   - If incorrect, it displays “That's incorrect. Try again!”
   - If nothing is selected, it prompts the user to select an answer.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
